# Fundamentals of Data Visualization, in Bokeh üìä

*‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This repository is a WIP, "watch" it to keep up with updates!*

## Project description

This repository hosts Bokeh equivalents for various plots from [*Fundamentals of Data Visualization* by Claus O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). It provides a collection of interactive data visualizations implemented using the Bokeh library.

The full rendered pages of this repository can be found [here](https://bokeh.github.io/dataviz-fundamentals/)
